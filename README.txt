Final Project: There and Back Again

Project Description:
This program is a game where you must collect coins and not get hit by the enemies to win.
It is set at night, so you must use a flashlight to look around. There is terrain generation
using perlin noise. The enemies and coins are randomly generated. The enemies sit still
and wait for you to get close, then they chase you.

Build Instructions:
Use the included ArcballCam.hpp in the ./include/CSCI441 folder.

File format read as input:
We used the .obj file format for all of our models. We used Blender to create some of the models and exported them as .obj files.

Distribution of responsibilities:
Everyone worked on the project together. We all contributed to the code and the work was done on Github.

Easter Egg:
There is a secret terrain in this game. Using the period(.) and comma(,) key, you can increase and decrease the seed.
To find the secret terrain, you must increase the seed to 300. Then zoom out the camera with scroll and look down. You
can make it easier to see with the daytime mode (L).
