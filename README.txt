A5 / Battle of the Five Armies

Walk around the world and collect all the coins! Enemies will continuously spawn and, if they get you, game over! WASD to move, standard arcball cam. Left shift to sprint,
Left control + mouse to change camera zoom, and up/down arrow keys to manually spawn more enemies. Right arrow key spawns in 10 at once.

Need all assets in assets/ folder to run. Also all shaders, types, and data folder.

It seems like the program randomly seg faults on launch but the stack trace goes back to glfwPollEvents(), before any of my code actually runs... not sure why this happens.

8 hours. I think

10!
10!

Had a lot of fun with this :D
